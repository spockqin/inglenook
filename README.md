Inglenook is a public knowledge curation platform incentivized by token economies enabled by blockchain. Inglenook removes the traditional need of a third party as the intermediary among users, i.e. enables decentralized content curation by all users. The generators of publicly supported content get rewarded with INK tokens and upvotes by users with more tokens carry more weight. Thus, network participants are encouraged to generate meaningful questions, valuable answers, and support thought-out answers and collectively curate the content on the platform.

Future directions include better interfaces, better reward algorithms, and a more full fledged full stack application.
